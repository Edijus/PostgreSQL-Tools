pgAdminDaemon

This PostgreSQL pgAdmin III utility allows you to disable "Previous queries" ComboBox. The accidents on losing SQL while unawarely scrolling on it happened a lot, so this application will get rid of that problem.
2-nd great feature is that it allows autocompletion:
  1) Ctrl+Q will type "SELECT * FROM"
  2) Ctrl+Shift+Space will autocomplete table names.
